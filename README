PingBack-Echo
-------------

This Sinatra app was built as a quick scratch-pad to test asynchronous pingbacks from APIs such as http://api.drop.io

It is pre-wired to run on heroku.  You can demo the app at http://echo.heroku.com

Or, you can run your own instance on heroku if you have the heroku gem installed:

git clone git@github.com:ChrisRicca/Pingback-Echo.git
cd Pingback-Echo
heroku create yourname-pingback-echo
git push heroku master
heroku open

Enjoy!
